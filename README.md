# Grenfell Tower Inquiry Scraper

I created this project in order to preserve the artifacts created as part of the
Grenfell Tower Inquiry so that they are preserved for our descendants. the
official inquiry website can be found at https://www.grenfelltowerinquiry.org.uk/.

To those who lost a loved one or a friend in the disaster you have my deep sympathy.
